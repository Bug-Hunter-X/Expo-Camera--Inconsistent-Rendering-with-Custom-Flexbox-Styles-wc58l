This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom styles.  Specifically, when applying flexbox styles to the `Camera` component, it sometimes fails to render or displays incorrectly. This is inconsistent and dependent on the specific styles applied, making debugging difficult. For example, setting `flex: 1` doesn't always work as expected. Sometimes the camera preview doesn't fill the available space, or it's clipped unexpectedly.
